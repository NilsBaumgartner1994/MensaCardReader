InterCard Reader for university of Osnabrück. Maybe other InterCards will also work.

Most credits of the content goes to (https://github.com/joarndt), which created by far the most of the code.

Just call the async function: readMensaCardInformations()

@returns {Promise<{currentBalance: *, lastTransaction: *, readTime: Date}|{currentBalance: *, lastTransaction: string, readTime: Date}|undefined>}
